# Nightmare Defenders

_(General project information goes here)_

## Story Editor
The "Editor" run configuration will run the editor from within IntelliJ IDEA.
The "Build the Editor" configuration will export the editor as an executable
jar to `editor/target/editor-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`; this file is
 an executable jar, so from the project directory, you can run it as:
 ```
 java -jar editor/target/editor-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
 ```
